**Note**: I have not registered on this course, but I decide to work through its homeworks. Do not ask me any my detail personal informations. Those necessary have been written in this file, or will be added in the future if I think needed at the time.

## Comments on homeworks 

### 1st and 2nd homework
- Using environment path you can use cmd to open Anaconda and ipython in Windows.
- Vim is not suitable on my surface pro because its font is too small to see on the screen.

### 3rd homework
I use two python files: StringDisplay.py and font.py to function that you can display the uppercase of whatever a string of alphabet you want (in full screen). Every line contains 10 letters, including space.

If you want to run my program, please download both files at the same directory, and run StringDisplay.py.

If you want to contribute some new charaters, or have questions or advices on this program, please use issues on GitHub.
