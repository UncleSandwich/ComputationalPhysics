#Population Growth Calculation

This program is used to calculate the population growth based on the equation $\frac{dN}{dt}=a*N-b*N^2$ showed in the exercise 1.6 of the textbook *Computational Physics*.

You can arbitrarily change the values of a, b, and initial population N_0, to see what phenomena will occur.
