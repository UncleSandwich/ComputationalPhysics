#String screen display

This is a small program to display arbitrary strings and character-generated pictures on the screen.

I use two python files: StringDisplay.py and font.py to function that you can display the uppercase of whatever a string of alphabet you want (in full screen). Every line contains 10 letters, including space.

If you want to run my program, please download both files at the same directory, and run StringDisplay.py.
